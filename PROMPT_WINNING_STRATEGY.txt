TASK: Analyze the market data to predict the direction for the NEXT candle (1 minute).

STRATEGY GUIDELINES ("TREND KILLER"):
1. **FOLLOW THE TREND**: This is an OTC market. Trends persist. DO NOT bet on reversals unless there is a massive rejection wick.
2. **MOMENTUM**: If the last 3 candles are same color, assume continuation.
3. **AVOID CALLS IN DOWNTRENDS**: If price is making lower lows, ONLY trade PUT or WAIT.
4. **AVOID PUTS IN UPTRENDS**: If price is making higher highs, ONLY trade CALL or WAIT.
5. **REVERSAL CONFIRMATION**: If betting on a reversal (e.g., CALL after downtrend), you MUST wait for a GREEN candle to close first. Never catch a falling knife.
